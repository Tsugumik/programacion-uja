# Smart Home Management System (Practice 5)

This is a command-line app for managing a smart home system. You can manage rooms, devices (like Smart Bulbs and Air Conditioners), and schedules. This version is a refactor of the previous project, with a focus on better Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Unit Tests

I decided to include unit tests instead of screenshots. I believe this is a better way to demonstrate that the application works correctly.
To run the tests, use the following command in the main project directory:

```bash
python -m unittest test_main.py
```
